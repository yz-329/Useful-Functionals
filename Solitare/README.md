# Solitaire

This is a self coded solitaire game required as an submission of assignment for Introduction to Software Fundamentals(COMPSCI 130 at University of Auckland).

I learned Tkinter to apply a simple GUI to enhance user interaction. Please find detailed instructions on how the game works under **Solitaire_Instruction.pdf**

# Functions explained for all files

## swap_upi.py
The file swaps parts of the filename text into the front so that it is more efficient when searching through the computer.

This file is created for my brother who wish to upload students' exam papers more efficient.
He downloaded exam papers with the format having students upi at the end.
This caused him unable to upload papers by searching students upi.
